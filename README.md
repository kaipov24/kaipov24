## Hi there 👋 I'm Kaipov Kairat

Salam! 👋🇰🇬

I’m transitioning into Backend Development with a strong focus on Go. I'm passionate about building scalable, reliable systems and excited to work on APIs, microservices, and backend infrastructure.

For over four years, I’ve worked as a Frontend Developer in a Growth Engineering team, where I helped ship high-impact experiments, optimized site performance and accessibility, and contributed to design systems and CMS platforms.

Outside of work, I am an Arsenal fan🔴⚪, I play video games, and I love chess♟️ and good music🎼.
